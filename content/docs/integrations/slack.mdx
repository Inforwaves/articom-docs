## Overview

Integrate Articom with Slack to receive notifications, manage conversations, and collaborate with your team directly from Slack.

The Slack integration enables you to:
- Receive real-time notifications about conversations
- Respond to customer messages from Slack
- Collaborate with team members
- Track agent performance
- Get automated alerts and reports

## Prerequisites

- Slack workspace with admin access
- Articom account with integration permissions

## Setup

### Step 1: Install Slack App

1. Go to Articom Dashboard → Integrations
2. Click "Connect Slack"
3. Authorize the Articom app for your workspace
4. Select channels for notifications

### Step 2: Configure Integration

```javascript
const slack = await articom.integrations.connect({
  type: "slack",
  config: {
    workspaceId: "YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID",
    accessToken: "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
    channels: {
      notifications: "#customer-support",
      alerts: "#urgent-alerts",
      reports: "#analytics"
    }
  }
});
```

## Features

### Real-time Notifications

Receive notifications in Slack when:
- New conversations start
- Messages require attention
- Agents need escalation
- SLA thresholds are reached

```javascript
slack.enableNotifications({
  events: [
    "conversation.started",
    "message.urgent",
    "agent.escalation",
    "sla.breach"
  ],
  channel: "#customer-support"
});
```

### Respond from Slack

```javascript
// Customer message appears in Slack
// Reply directly using thread

slack.onSlackMessage(async (event) => {
  if (event.thread_ts) {
    // This is a reply to a customer thread
    const conversationId = getConversationFromThread(event.thread_ts);
    
    await articom.sendMessage({
      conversationId,
      text: event.text,
      agentId: event.user
    });
  }
});
```

### Slash Commands

Use Slack commands to control Articom:

```
/articom status - View current status
/articom stats - Show today's statistics
/articom escalate [conversation_id] - Escalate conversation
/articom assign [agent] [conversation_id] - Assign conversation
```

### Interactive Buttons

```javascript
// Message with action buttons
await slack.sendMessage({
  channel: "#support",
  text: "New urgent inquiry from John Doe",
  attachments: [
    {
      text: "Customer asking about refund policy",
      callback_id: "conversation_123",
      actions: [
        {
          name: "claim",
          text: "Claim",
          type: "button",
          value: "claim"
        },
        {
          name: "escalate",
          text: "Escalate",
          type: "button",
          value: "escalate",
          style: "danger"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
});
```

### Daily Reports

```javascript
// Automated daily summary
slack.scheduleReport({
  channel: "#analytics",
  time: "09:00",
  timezone: "America/New_York",
  template: "daily_summary",
  content: {
    conversations: true,
    resolution_rate: true,
    satisfaction_score: true,
    top_agents: true
  }
});
```

## Alerts & Monitoring

### Custom Alerts

```javascript
slack.createAlert({
  name: "High Volume Alert",
  condition: {
    metric: "active_conversations",
    operator: ">",
    value: 100
  },
  channel: "#alerts",
  message: "⚠️ High conversation volume detected!"
});
```

### SLA Monitoring

```javascript
slack.monitorSLA({
  channel: "#urgent",
  thresholds: {
    warning: "5 minutes",
    critical: "10 minutes"
  },
  notifyUsers: ["@manager", "@supervisor"]
});
```

## Team Collaboration

### Conversation Threads

Customer conversations appear as Slack threads:
- View conversation history
- Add internal notes
- Tag team members
- Share resources

### Internal Notes

```javascript
// Add private note visible only to team
await slack.addNote({
  conversationId: "conv_123",
  note: "Customer is VIP - handle with priority",
  tags: ["@john", "@sarah"],
  visibility: "team_only"
});
```

## Advanced Features

### Workflow Builder

```javascript
// Create automated workflow
const workflow = await slack.createWorkflow({
  name: "Escalation Workflow",
  trigger: {
    type: "conversation.escalated"
  },
  steps: [
    {
      action: "post_to_channel",
      channel: "#escalations",
      message: "Escalation needed for {{customer_name}}"
    },
    {
      action: "notify_user",
      users: ["@manager"],
      message: "Please review escalated case"
    },
    {
      action: "create_ticket",
      priority: "high"
    }
  ]
});
```

### Bot Mentions

```javascript
// Respond when bot is mentioned
slack.onMention(async (event) => {
  const query = event.text.replace(/<@BOT_ID>/g, '').trim();
  
  // Query Articom
  const result = await articom.search({
    query,
    type: "knowledge_base"
  });
  
  await slack.reply({
    channel: event.channel,
    thread_ts: event.ts,
    text: result.answer
  });
});
```

## Analytics in Slack

## Best Practices

### 1. Channel Organization
- `#customer-support` - Main support channel
- `#escalations` - Urgent cases
- `#analytics` - Reports and dashboards
- `#bot-alerts` - Automated notifications

### 2. Response Management
Set up clear workflows for claiming and responding to messages.

### 3. Use Threads
Keep conversations organized using threads.

### 4. Tag Appropriately
Use @mentions to route urgent issues.

### 5. Mute When Needed
Configure notification preferences to avoid alert fatigue.

## Configuration

```javascript
const slackConfig = {
  notifications: {
    enabled: true,
    channels: {
      default: "#customer-support",
      urgent: "#escalations",
      reports: "#analytics"
    },
    filters: {
      priority: ["high", "urgent"],
      sentiment: ["negative"],
      keywords: ["refund", "complaint", "cancel"]
    }
  },
  features: {
    threadedReplies: true,
    slashCommands: true,
    interactiveButtons: true,
    dailyReports: true
  }
};
```

## Troubleshooting

**Not Receiving Notifications**
