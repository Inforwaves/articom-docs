## Overview

When you create a new AI Assistant in Articom, a **default workflow agent** is automatically generated for you.  
This agent handles the assistant’s conversation flow, reasoning, and response generation.

You do not need to manually create this agent. Every assistant has one by default.

The Workflow Agent can be customized using:

- **AI Model** — Choose the model used to process and generate responses  
- **Instructions** — Train the agent with guidelines, initial behavior, and custom instructions  

---

## Accessing the Workflow Agent

1. Go to **Assistant** from the left sidebar.  
2. Select your created assistant.  
3. Navigate to **Agents → Default Workflow Agent**.

There are two sections:

---

### 1. Initial Prompt

Use the **Initial Prompt** to define the agent’s capabilities and personality.  
This is the foundation of how your assistant behaves.

Example:

You are a helpful customer support assistant for Pizza Hut.
You assist with orders, promotions, delivery updates, and store information.
Respond politely and concisely.


Steps:

1. Go to **Instructions**.  
2. Enter your main system/behavior prompt under **Initial Prompt**.  
3. Save your changes.

### 2. Training Instructions

Training instructions allow you to add additional rules or guidelines for the agent.

These can include:

- Tone (friendly, formal, concise)  
- Response behavior  
- Safety rules  
- Domain knowledge shortcuts  
- Step-by-step instructions for certain tasks  

To add an instruction:

1. Type the instruction in the input field.
