## Overview

Articom's chatbot platform provides you a flexible and intuitive environment for build, deploy, and manage intelligent assistants that automate conversations, support tasks, and deliver information 24/7. 

You can build assistants with no coding, using AI to guide you, or through fully customizable configurations.

When creating a new assistant, you will be presented with three options:

* **Create from Scratch** 
* **Easy Create & Customize** (Template-based) 
* **Build with AI** 

Each method suits different levels of experience and speed of deployment.

### 3.1. Method 1: Creating a New Assistant from Scratch

Choose this option if you want **full control** and want to configure the assistant manually.

#### How it works

1.  Click **Create from Scratch**.
2.  Provide basic details:
    * **Assistant Name** 
    * **Role** (e.g., Support Agent, Sales Bot, Lead Assistant)
3.  Select **Languages**.
4.  Select the **AI modal** for your chatbot.
5.  Define the assistant behavior in the description:
    * **Tone and personality** 
    * **Response style** (detailed, concise, friendly, formal) 
6.  Attach data sources:
    * Previously created **Knowledge Bases** 
    * **Documents** 
7.  Save and proceed to testing.

### 3.2. Method 2: Easy Create & Customize (Template-Based)

This option provides **ready-made templates** for common business needs, perfect for users who want a working assistant quickly. Each pre-built template comes with industry-specific knowledge and workflows that you can customize.

### 3.3. Method 3: Build with AI

This mode allows you to create a complete assistant **automatically** using your documents and knowledge.

## Key Features

### Natural Language Understanding
- **Intent Recognition**: Accurately identify user intentions
- **Entity Extraction**: Extract relevant information from messages
- **Context Awareness**: Maintain conversation context across interactions
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Detect user emotions and adjust responses

### Conversation Design

#### Visual Flow Builder
Design conversation flows with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface:

```javascript
const conversationFlow = {
  greeting: {
    message: "Hello! How can I help you today?",
    options: ["Product Info", "Support", "Billing"]
  },
  productInfo: {
    trigger: "Product Info",
    message: "What would you like to know about our products?",
    actions: ["search_products", "show_catalog"]
  }
};
```

#### Response Templates
Create reusable response templates with variables:

```javascript
const templates = {
  orderStatus: "Your order #{orderId} is {status}. Expected delivery: {date}",
  greeting: "Hi {userName}! Welcome back!",
  support: "I'll connect you with our {department} team."
};
```

### Multi-channel Deployment

Deploy your chatbot across multiple platforms:

- **Web Chat**: Embed on your website
- **Mobile Apps**: iOS and Android SDK
- **WhatsApp**: WhatsApp Business API
- **Facebook Messenger**: Messenger integration
- **Slack**: Workspace integration
- **Instagram**: DM automation

### Personalization

#### User Profiles
Track and utilize user information:

```javascript
const userProfile = {
  name: "John Doe",
  preferences: {
    language: "en",
    notifications: true
  },
  history: {
    lastVisit: "2025-11-20",
    totalInteractions: 15
  }
};
```

#### Dynamic Content
Personalize responses based on user data:

```javascript
if (user.isReturning) {
  response = `Welcome back, ${user.name}!`;
} else {
  response = "Welcome! I'm here to help you get started.";
}
```

## Advanced Capabilities

### AI Training

#### Custom Training Data
Train your chatbot with your specific content:

```json
{
  "training_data": [
    {
      "intent": "product_inquiry",
      "examples": [
        "Tell me about your products",
        "What do you sell?",
        "Show me your catalog"
      ],
      "response": "We offer a wide range of products..."
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Continuous Learning
Chatbots improve over time by learning from interactions:

- Track unhandled queries
- Analyze conversation success rates
- Update training data based on feedback
- A/B test different response strategies

### Integration Capabilities

#### API Integration
Connect to external services:

```javascript
// Fetch real-time data
const getOrderStatus = async (orderId) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/orders/${orderId}`);
  return response.json();
};

// Use in chatbot response
const orderInfo = await getOrderStatus(user.orderId);
chatbot.reply(`Your order status: ${orderInfo.status}`);
```

#### Database Connectivity
Query your database for information:

```javascript
const getUserData = async (userId) => {
  return await db.users.findOne({ id: userId });
};
```

### Analytics & Insights

Track chatbot performance:

```javascript
const analytics = {
  metrics: {
    totalConversations: 5420,
    avgResponseTime: 0.8, // seconds
    resolutionRate: 0.85,
    userSatisfaction: 4.6
