# Chatbot

Create sophisticated AI-powered chatbots that engage customers with natural, human-like conversations across multiple platforms.

## Overview

Articom's chatbot platform enables you to build, deploy, and manage intelligent conversational agents that can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and drive engagement 24/7.

## Key Features

### Natural Language Understanding
- **Intent Recognition**: Accurately identify user intentions
- **Entity Extraction**: Extract relevant information from messages
- **Context Awareness**: Maintain conversation context across interactions
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Detect user emotions and adjust responses

### Conversation Design

#### Visual Flow Builder
Design conversation flows with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface:

```javascript
const conversationFlow = {
  greeting: {
    message: "Hello! How can I help you today?",
    options: ["Product Info", "Support", "Billing"]
  },
  productInfo: {
    trigger: "Product Info",
    message: "What would you like to know about our products?",
    actions: ["search_products", "show_catalog"]
  }
};
```

#### Response Templates
Create reusable response templates with variables:

```javascript
const templates = {
  orderStatus: "Your order #{orderId} is {status}. Expected delivery: {date}",
  greeting: "Hi {userName}! Welcome back!",
  support: "I'll connect you with our {department} team."
};
```

### Multi-channel Deployment

Deploy your chatbot across multiple platforms:

- **Web Chat**: Embed on your website
- **Mobile Apps**: iOS and Android SDK
- **WhatsApp**: WhatsApp Business API
- **Facebook Messenger**: Messenger integration
- **Slack**: Workspace integration
- **Instagram**: DM automation

### Personalization

#### User Profiles
Track and utilize user information:

```javascript
const userProfile = {
  name: "John Doe",
  preferences: {
    language: "en",
    notifications: true
  },
  history: {
    lastVisit: "2025-11-20",
    totalInteractions: 15
  }
};
```

#### Dynamic Content
Personalize responses based on user data:

```javascript
if (user.isReturning) {
  response = `Welcome back, ${user.name}!`;
} else {
  response = "Welcome! I'm here to help you get started.";
}
```

## Advanced Capabilities

### AI Training

#### Custom Training Data
Train your chatbot with your specific content:

```json
{
  "training_data": [
    {
      "intent": "product_inquiry",
      "examples": [
        "Tell me about your products",
        "What do you sell?",
        "Show me your catalog"
      ],
      "response": "We offer a wide range of products..."
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Continuous Learning
Chatbots improve over time by learning from interactions:

- Track unhandled queries
- Analyze conversation success rates
- Update training data based on feedback
- A/B test different response strategies

### Integration Capabilities

#### API Integration
Connect to external services:

```javascript
// Fetch real-time data
const getOrderStatus = async (orderId) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/orders/${orderId}`);
  return response.json();
};

// Use in chatbot response
const orderInfo = await getOrderStatus(user.orderId);
chatbot.reply(`Your order status: ${orderInfo.status}`);
```

#### Database Connectivity
Query your database for information:

```javascript
const getUserData = async (userId) => {
  return await db.users.findOne({ id: userId });
};
```

### Analytics & Insights

Track chatbot performance:

```javascript
const analytics = {
  metrics: {
    totalConversations: 5420,
    avgResponseTime: 0.8, // seconds
    resolutionRate: 0.85,
    userSatisfaction: 4.6
  },
  topIntents: [
    "product_inquiry",
    "order_status",
    "technical_support"
  ]
};
```

## Building Your First Chatbot

### Step 1: Create Bot

```javascript

  examples: [

    "hi",
    "hey there",
    "good morning"
  ],
  response: "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
});
```

### Step 3: Add Actions

```javascript
bot.addAction({
  name: "search_products",
  handler: async (query) => {
    const results = await searchProducts(query);
    return formatProductResults(results);
  }
});
```

### Step 4: Deploy

});
```

## Best Practices

  };
});
```

### 3. Seamless Handoff
```javascript
if (requiresHumanAgent) {
  bot.escalate({
