# Voice Agents

Create intelligent voice agents that handle phone calls and voice interactions with natural speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities.

## Overview

Articom's Voice Agents enable businesses to automate phone support, conduct voice surveys, and provide voice-based customer service with human-like conversations.

## Key Features

- **Accent Recognition**: Understand various accents and dialects
- **Noise Cancellation**: Filter background noise for clarity

### Natural Voice Synthesis

- **Custom Voice Branding**: Train custom voices for your brand
- **Emotion & Tone**: Adjust voice emotion and speaking style
- **Speech Rate Control**: Customize speaking speed

### Conversation Management

#### Call Flow Design
Design voice conversation flows:

```javascript
const callFlow = {
  greeting: {
    message: "Thank you for calling. How can I help you today?",
    listen: true,
    timeout: 5000
  },
  intent_routing: {
    intents: {
      "account_balance": "handle_balance_inquiry",
      "make_payment": "handle_payment",
      "speak_agent": "transfer_to_human"
    }
  }
};
```

#### Intent Recognition
Understand caller intentions:

```javascript
const voiceIntent = await recognizeIntent(audioInput);

if (voiceIntent.confidence > 0.8) {
  executeAction(voiceIntent.action);
} else {
  clarifyIntent();
}
```

## Voice Agent Types

### Inbound Voice Agents

#### Customer Support
Handle incoming customer service calls:

```javascript
const supportAgent = {
  greeting: "Thank you for calling support. Please describe your issue.",
  capabilities: [
    "account_lookup",
    "troubleshooting",
    "appointment_scheduling",
    "human_transfer"
  ]
};
```

#### IVR (Interactive Voice Response)
Automated menu navigation:

```javascript
const ivr = {
  menu: {
    message: "Press 1 for Sales, 2 for Support, 3 for Billing",
    options: {
      1: "sales_department",
      2: "support_department",
      3: "billing_department"
    }
  }
};
```

### Outbound Voice Agents

#### Appointment Reminders
Automated reminder calls:

```javascript
const reminder = {
  message: `Hi ${customer.name}, this is a reminder about your appointment tomorrow at ${appointment.time}. Press 1 to confirm or 2 to reschedule.`,
  actions: {
    1: "confirm_appointment",
    2: "start_reschedule_flow"
  }
};
```

#### Surveys & Feedback
Conduct voice surveys:

```javascript
const survey = {
  questions: [
    {
      text: "On a scale of 1 to 5, how satisfied were you?",
      type: "numeric",
      range: [1, 5]
    },
    {
      text: "Would you recommend us to others?",
      type: "yes_no"
    }
  ]
};
```

## Advanced Features

### Voice Biometrics

#### Speaker Identification
Identify callers by voice:

```javascript
const voicePrint = await analyzeVoice(audioSample);
const caller = await identifySpeaker(voicePrint);

if (caller.authenticated) {
  proceedWithSecureActions();
}
```

#### Fraud Detection
Detect suspicious call patterns:

```javascript
const fraudScore = await analyzeFraudRisk({
  voicePattern: audioSample,
  callerHistory: caller.history,
  contextSignals: callMetadata
});
```

### Sentiment Analysis

Detect caller emotion in real-time:

```javascript
const sentiment = await analyzeSentiment(audioStream);

if (sentiment.emotion === "frustrated") {
  adjustTone("empathetic");
  offerEscalation();
}
```

### Call Recording & Transcription

```javascript
const callRecord = {
  id: "call_123",
  duration: 342, // seconds
  transcript: "Full conversation transcript...",
  summary: "Customer inquired about order status",
  sentiment: "positive",
  resolution: "resolved"
};
```

## Implementation

### Setup Voice Agent

```javascript
const voiceAgent = articom.createVoiceAgent({
  name: "Customer Service Agent",
  voice: {
    provider: "google",
    name: "en-US-Neural2-F",
    rate: 1.0,
    pitch: 0
  },
  language: "en-US",
  features: {
    recording: true,
    transcription: true,
    sentiment: true,
    barge_in: true // Allow user to interrupt
  }
});
```

### Configure Speech Recognition

```javascript
voiceAgent.setSpeechConfig({
  model: "enhanced",
  profanityFilter: true,
  enableAutomaticPunctuation: true,
  speechContexts: [
    {
      phrases: ["account number", "order ID", "product name"]
    }
  ]
});
```

### Handle Voice Intents

```javascript
voiceAgent.onIntent("check_balance", async (context) => {
  const accountNumber = await extractEntity("account_number", context);
  const balance = await getAccountBalance(accountNumber);
  
  return {
    response: `Your current balance is $${balance.toFixed(2)}`,
    action: "end_call"
  };
});
```

### Phone Number Integration

```javascript
const phoneNumber = await articom.provisionNumber({
  country: "US",
  type: "local",
  area_code: "415"
});

phoneNumber.assignAgent(voiceAgent.id);
```

## Voice Quality Optimization

### Audio Settings

```javascript
const audioConfig = {
  sampleRate: 16000, // Hz
  encoding: "LINEAR16",
  channels: 1,
  codec: "OPUS"
};
```

### Latency Reduction

```javascript
voiceAgent.optimize({
  streamingRecognition: true,
  partialResults: true,
  singleUtterance: false,
  interimResults: true
});
```

## Analytics & Monitoring

### Call Metrics

```javascript
const callMetrics = {
  totalCalls: 2450,
  avgDuration: 186, // seconds
  completionRate: 0.92,
  transferRate: 0.08,
  customerSatisfaction: 4.5,
  firstCallResolution: 0.87
};
```

### Performance Tracking

```javascript
const performance = {
  speechRecognitionAccuracy: 0.96,
  intentRecognitionAccuracy: 0.93,
  avgLatency: 450, // ms
  uptime: 0.999
};
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear Voice Prompts
```javascript
// Good: Clear and concise
"Please say or press 1 for sales."

// Avoid: Too verbose
"If you would like to speak with someone in our sales department..."
```

### 2. Error Handling
```javascript
voiceAgent.onNoInput(() => {
  attemptCount++;
  if (attemptCount >= 3) {
    return transferToHuman();
  }
  return "I didn't hear that. Could you please repeat?";
});
```

### 3. Graceful Fallback
```javascript
if (intent.confidence < 0.7) {
  return {
    message: "Let me transfer you to someone who can help.",
    action: "transfer_to_agent"
  };
}
```

### 4. Natural Conversations
- Use conversational language
- Avoid technical jargon
