Agent: "I'm very sorry to hear that your order arrived damaged. I understand how 
        frustrating this must be. Let me help you resolve this right away. 
        May I have your order number?"

Customer: "#12345"
Agent: "Thank you. I've pulled up order #12345. I can offer you:
        1. Full refund
        2. Replacement shipped with express delivery
        Which would you prefer?"

Customer: "Replacement please"

        You'll receive it by Nov 21. I've also applied a 20% discount to your next
